#Octave scripts for use with RTL-SDR dongles

This is a repository of scripts for Octave (and MATLAB with some editing) for use with RTL-SDR software defined radio dongles and Osmocom drivers and software.

##rtlheatmap.m

The rtlheapmap.m file is an Octave script to read a time-series measurement file produced using rtl_power and save it as a colourful heatmap graph.

The name of the image (PNG) file is specified in the last line of the script, although the script is easily edited to specify it from the commandline instead.
